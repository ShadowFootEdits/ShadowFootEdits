Show me the path that leads to righteousness and peace. Give me discernment to recognize what is right and what is wrong. Close the doors that are not meant for me, even if they seem good. Open the doors that align with Your perfect will for my life. Surround me with wise counsel that speaks Your truth. Help me make choices that bring glory to Your name. Let my decisions be rooted in faith and not in fear. Thank You, Lord, for leading me every step of the way. Amen.",
                "Father, I feel lost and uncertain in the struggles I face. The road ahead seems difficult, and I do not know what to do. But I know that You are my refuge, my strength, and my guide. Even in darkness, Your light leads me forward. Help me trust that You are working, even when I do not see it. Give me the patience to endure and the wisdom to walk in faith. When fear and doubt try to take over, remind me of Your promises. You have never failed me, and I know You never will. Lead me, Lord, through this storm, and bring me closer to You. I place my hope in You alone. Amen.",
